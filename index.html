    <p>Hello there. My name is Sheriff Subair, and I help SaaS companies convert qualified leads and drive real business growth. Well, that's what I do now. But it's certainly not the only thing I'm interested in. I'm also learning to code -- who doesn't want to build the next billion-dollar product. I thought I wanted to be a musicianðŸ™‚ -- I actually can sing, I think. Shoot me an email at <a href="subairomogbolahan@gmail.com">subairomogbolahan@gmail.com</a><br><br>P.S. I can be boring. Please don't be too.</p>
